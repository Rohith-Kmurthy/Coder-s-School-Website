**Structure (HTML)**

**1) Header / Navigation** :A sticky top header (<header>) with the college name as a logo and a simple navigation bar linking to four sections: Home, About, Courses, Contact. Navigation uses in-page anchors (#hero, #about, etc.) so the page scrolls smoothly when users click.

**2) Hero Section:** Featured at the top with a full-width background image (via Unsplash) dimmed by a dark overlay. Includes a strong headline (“Your Future Starts Here”), a subheading, and a call-to-action button (“Apply Now”) that triggers a JavaScript function applyNow().

**3)About Section:** A concise introduction describing the college’s prestige and mission, styled straightforwardly for clarity and readability.

**4) Courses Section:** A visually distinct section (light-gray background) showcasing course offerings in a responsive grid layout:
Augumented & Virtual Reality
Artificial Intelligence & Data Science
Cyber Security
Full Stack Development
Each course is presented as a card with hover animations to enhance interactivity.

**5) Contact Section**: Provides basic contact info: email and phone number.

**6) Footer:** A simple footer repeating the header’s dark-blue background, containing a copyright.

**7) External Resources**
style.css for visuals
Google Fonts (Poppins) for typography
script.js presumably handles applyNow() (likely a redirect or form popup)

**Design / Styling (CSS)**
Global Reset for consistent margins, padding, and box-model.
Makes use of scroll-behavior: smooth for gentle section transitions.

**Color Palette:**
Deep blue header/footer (#003366)
Light gray backgrounds (#eef3f8)
Bright accent turquoise (#00ccff) for buttons and hover effects

**Typography:**
Poppins font, readable text sizes, good heading contrast

**Hero Styling:**
Dramatic background image with dark overlay for text readability
Centralized, large and bold typography

**Course Cards:**
White cards with subtle box-shadow

Hover effect: slight lift and background color shift to turquoise tint

**Responsiveness**
Employs a grid layout for course cards with repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)), ensuring fluid resizing across devices.
container max-width of 1200px with margin auto keeps content centered and well-compressed on narrow screens.

**Interactivity & Usability**
Sticky Navigation: Remains visible while scrolling for easy access.
Button Hover Effects & Transitions: Provide tactile feedback and polished experience.
Smooth Scrolling improves navigation between sections.
Call-to-Action button triggers a JavaScript hook, ready for application logic.

**Summary**
A well-structured, responsive, and visually pleasing single-page site template for educational institutions.
Strong focus on usability: smooth navigation, clear calls to action, and adaptive layouts.
Easily extensible — adding more courses, sections, or backend features would integrate smoothly.
